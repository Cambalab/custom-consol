# Contributing

Contributions will be accepted from **pull requests**. They must always be referenced to an issue. To create a **pull request** you must create a new branch first, push it's content and finally create a pull request from the new branch against the development branch.

**Branches should be named in the following way:**

If the Pull request contains a requested feature:
+ feature-#issueNumber-issue-description

*example:*
```
  feature-#2-implements-basic-styles
```

If the Pull request contains a bug fix:
+ hotfix-#issueNumber-issue-description

*example:*
```
  hotfix-#15-fixes-data-table-pagination
```

If the Pull request contains documentation updates:
+ doc-#issueNumber-documentation-description-between

*example:*
```
  doc-#9-generates-contributing-docs
```
